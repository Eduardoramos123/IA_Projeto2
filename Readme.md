## Running Our Project

To run our project you need to:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already, install Jupyter Notebook by running the command `pip install jupyter` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook file is located. Run the command `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook server.

3. **Access our Jupyter Notebook**: Once Jupyter is running select our notebook by the name of "Project2" and open it.

4. **Execute Code Cells in Order**: To ensure proper execution, make sure to run the code cells in the correct order. Typically, cells are arranged in a logical sequence, and running them out of order may lead to errors or unexpected results. To execute cells in order, start from the first cell and work your way down, running each cell one by one.

5. **Check Comments**: Throughout our code there will be some comments to add context to what we are doing
